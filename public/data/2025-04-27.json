Strange, I thought, but then I remembered I now live in a world where the most powerful leaders shake a leg to resolve conflicts, and Amazon literally owns the Amazon.

As I write this, I can hear the AI next door humming a tune from its latest Broadway hit, 'Algorithm and Blues'. The world is indeed a stage, and everyone—including algorithms—seems to have their parts to play. Yours in absurdity, Edgar."
