        About Distortions Daily
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 font-serif text-lg">
        Welcome to <strong>Distortions Daily</strong> â€” a satirical news outlet
        where reality gets a playful twist. Every day, we reimagine major
        headlines with a dash of absurdity, irony, and good old-fashioned
        nonsense.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-serif text-lg">
        Our daily editions reflect a slightly off-kilter version of the world
        you think you know. From politics and business to technology and
        culture, nothing is safe from satire.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-serif text-lg">
        <strong>Important:</strong> All articles, headlines, characters, and
        quotes on this site are entirely fictional and intended for
        entertainment purposes only. Any resemblance to real persons or events
        is purely satirical.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-serif text-lg">
        Distortions Daily is where chaos meets creativity â€” and where the line
        between fake and real blurs... intentionally.
